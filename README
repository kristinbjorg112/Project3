To compile:

	Use the command "make all" or the commands
	g++ -std=c++11 client.cpp -lpthread -o client
	g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o tsamvgroup20

To run (on same machine):

    ./tsamvgroup20 10000
    ./client 127.0.0.1 10000

##Features
The botnet allowes a client to connect to a server and remotely control it. All messages
between servers have 0x01 and 0x04 as start and end of message characters. The server will
allow 5 connections to itself before randomly closing a connection to some connected server
to make space for a new connection.

##Commands that client can send to server:

GETMSG <groupID> : Get message from the server with given GROUP ID
SENDMSG <groupID> : Send a message to the server for this group
LISTSERVERS : Lists all servers that our server is connected to
SC <ip> <port> : Connects the server to a server with this IP and port.

LEAVE <server_ip> <port> : Makes server to disconect to this server if it is connected to it.
LEAVE <server_ip> <port> <groupID> : Makes the server send LEAVE command to another server.


##Commands that the server can send to another server:
We decided that the server sends LISTSERVERS when it connects to another server. 
The client will tell the server to send the commands to another server.
The server can send these commands to another server through client:

LEAVE <server_ip> <port> <groupID> : Makes the server send 

The server can recive theses commands from another servers :
LISTSERVERS: it will respond with the servers that it is connected to.
LEAVE <server_ip> <port>: The server disconects to the server with this ip and port.
SEND MSG,<FROM GROUP ID>,<TO GROUP ID>,<Message content>: The server checks if the message is for him
if the it is so it will print it out. If the message is for a group that it is connected to it will forward it. 
If it is not connected it will keep the message until someone will get it. 
GETMSG,<GROUPID>
